# belly-button-challenge

In this weekly challenge, I built a dashboard that illustrates biodiversity of belly buttons. 

This is done through a drop-down that selects the person ID - where the biodiversity is visualized via 

1) Bar-Chart of operational taxonomic units

2) Bubble-Chart of operatuional taxonomic units with values illustrated by marker size.
